## Development

### Update built-in scripts

required

- rust/cargo
- capsule https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule/releases
- docker

update submodule inside `ckb` and then run

```sh
make all
```

### Update chain config

edit the things in `ckb/devnet`

All the script configs are generated by `ckb list-hashes` so you don't need to care about it.

### Update templates

edit the things in `templates/v${version}`

### Install dependencies

Since we use `pnpm` as a developing package manager, people install `offckb` by `npm` would require a `package-lock.json` file.

```sh
npm i --package-lock-only
```

Remember to run the above command when trying to publish a new version.
